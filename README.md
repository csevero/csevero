# Hello, I'm Carlos ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Developer focused on creating high-performance Web Applications and scalable Backend Solutions. My experience spans building modern front-end applications with **ReactJS** and **NextJS** and developing robust backend systems using **NodeJS** and **NestJS**. I have a solid background in working with cloud platforms like **AWS**, **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, and **Digital Ocean** to deploy, manage, and scale applications efficiently.

In addition, I specialize in **Twilio services**, where I've built solutions for automated messaging, customer notifications, and custom workflows within **Twilio Flex** Contact Center. My work with Twilio includes creating serverless functions, setting up complex routing in **TaskRouter**, managing real-time communication with **Conversations** and **Programmable Chat**, and using **Frontline** and **Verify** to enable secure and personalized user interactions. My goal is to enhance communication experiences, improve customer support processes, and deliver seamless, scalable solutions.
